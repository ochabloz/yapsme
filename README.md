#### _Yet Another PlayStation Emulator_

This is my attempt at emulating a PlayStation console.

One of the long run goal would be to allow debugging, decompiling and memory watching

The **yaPSME** project started as a way to practice _Test Driven Development_ using cppUTest harness

As of today the CPU and all of the PlayStation components are emulated in LLE (_Low Level Emulation_) mode.


## Usage
This piece of software is not intended for general use and is provided as it is. Since better emulator for the PlayStation exists and I am only trying to reinvent the wheel, no support will be provided.

### Additional files
    * in order to boot, bios files must be present in the __roms/__ folder
